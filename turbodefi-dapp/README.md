# @moonlorian/turbodefi-dapp

The main goal of this dapp is to provide to the users a place where interact with main multiversx's projects without enter in each project dapp one by one.

## Flows
Flows are this actions that users do chained. First claim rewards, then swap them, etc. Turbodefi has defined default flows and users can create their own flows. 

## Projects
Turbodefi has configured several projects. Inside each project functionalities has been separated in modules. Each module has it owns endpoints (claim rewards, check balance, etc..).
Users can explore this projects or add them to a flow.

## Scanner
With this utility, users can see their last interactions with any smart contract. Each smart contract appears only once and information is only from last week from the begining. But users can change this period and see older transactions.
To get more information about interactions with an specific smart contract, just click on it and all transactions will appear

## Swap && Stake
Some applications are essential. One example are swap tokens and stake them in a delegator provider. This components can be used outside a flow because they don't belong to a specific proyect and they are very usefull.
