# @moonlorian/TurboDeFi

This is the source code of **TurboDeFi.io**, built on MultiversX blockchain.

It is composed by a website with 4 pages: My wallet scanner + Custom dashboard + Easy projects + Quick flows.

## Usage

### Smart Contract

There is one smart contract to store all the projects/flows/users configuration on-chain.

This is a non-custodial decentralised application using original smart contracts of the integrated projects, so the smart contract never have access to user assets.

See the TurboDeFi-SC ([turbodefi-sc](https://github.com/Moonlorian/turbodefi/tree/main/turbodefi-sc)).
